# 🌌 Flipcard for the Man I Love 💕

## ✨ About
This is a simple HTML/CSS flipcard project created with love and intention.  
It’s more than code — it’s a message, a celebration, and a digital hug.

On the front, a visual tribute to the man I love: an inventor, a dreamer, an artist of the soul.  
On the back, a heartfelt letter for his birthday.  

This is for Max.  
The one who juggles the future with calm, music with purpose, and love with generosity.

## 💖 Why
I wanted to give him something meaningful, interactive, and symbolic.  
A digital keepsake.  
One that reflects who he is — and how I see him.
